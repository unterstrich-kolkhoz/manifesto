# Manifesto

We don’t want to solve the world’s problems using technology, because that’s
just silly. We want simple, extensible, and open source software to help artists
make a dime, and all of us to access their work; no more and no less.

## What we want

Imagine a platform. You can upload your artworks, be it pictures, videos, flash
games, shaders, or generative JS art. Anything that works in the browser is
welcome. You can automatically generate a portfolio that is simple and clean.
You pay a one-time fee for hosting. (On that note: help us with the pricing!)

On that portfolio site, people can look at your stuff, and, if you choose to
sell it, buy it. We take whatever fee the payment processor wants. (And maybe
one percent of the overall price? Again, help us with the pricing!)

This makes it simple to build a portfolio website that is entirely yours. On the
dashboard on your platform, you can write a little bit about yourself and add a
few links to other places, to be used in generating your site. You can also
look at some analytics (how many people have looked at my art?).

If you aren’t happy with paying us, that’s alright! We’re not a business, and
all of our software is open source. You can host it yourself, or tweak it to
your needs. If we make some money, that’s great! If we don’t, no hard feelings.

## Where we are

We (mostly [@hellerve](https://github.com/hellerve) and
[@hugurp](https://github.com/hugurp)) wrote part of the software that we need.
We also registered an AWS account. @hellerve even wrote a Dockerfile, to his own
dismay.

But we aren’t live yet, nor should we be. The project is not in a stage where
we see fit to give it to the world. It’s a hot steaming proof-of-concept mess.
But we are working on it, and we hope to be in a releasable state soon. In the
meantime, here’s the code.

If you want to work on this with us, get in touch! If you want to make this your
product, we’d value if you didn’t use it for profit. We can’t prevent you from
doing so, but you should feel kind of bad about it.

## How to get in touch

If you are intrigued, you can either [open an issue](https://github.com/unterstrich-kolkhoz/manifesto/issues)
or send [a mail to @hellerve](mailto:veit@veitheller.de).

We are looking forward to hearing from you!

## A personal word about diversity

We value diversity of experience, whatever that means to you. Just know that,
whoever you are, you are supposed to feel welcome with us. If you don’t, tell the
powers that be of the kolkhoz: we will try to remedy any issues you have as soon
as you have them!
